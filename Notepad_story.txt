ok, I am supposed to be writing something here, but I am also being held against my will in the basement. My conciousness is communicating with my body for the purpose of warning others who may be in danger, severe danger. My name is Arthur Evans and I may have made the most surprising archaological discovery in millenia! I have found a way to seperate my consciousness from my body. Ever since I found the tomb of ancient Egyptian Pharaohs, I have had this weird dream. At least I thought it was a dream.
